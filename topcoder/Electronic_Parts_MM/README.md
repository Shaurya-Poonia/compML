# Problem: ElectronicPartsClassification

Competition Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In TopCoder Marathon Match events, the system will be testing submissions for optimization according to the scoring criteria outlined in the problem statement that is associated with this event.	Each event may have a different scoring mechanism. Competitors will have to understand the scoring mechanism in order to effectively compete. Participants may submit code written in one of the following languages: Java, C++, C#.NET, VB.NET, or Python.

Once the submission phase of a Marathon Match has ended, final testing will run and may take several days to complete. Upon completion of final testing, the final results will become available in the Marathon Match Archive on the web site. Competitors will be able to see the test case details, other competitors' submissions, and all final results. For rated events, the ratings will be adjusted once results are final.

Problem Statement
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An electronics parts supplier ("Supplier") sells thousands of parts to businesses nationwide. The firm’s customers view a certain subset of parts differently from the rest. Parts in that subset are readily available, can be purchased from more firms than just the Supplier, and are integral to the business operations of the Supplier's customers. As a result, the firm refers to these items as "special parts" ("SPs").

SPs are believed to meet the following criteria:

A customer purchases an SP in similar quantities over time:

Regardless of changes in "the market price" (i.e., PRODUCT_COST1 in the data set); and
Regardless of change in price markup over "the market price" (i.e., PRODUCT_COST1 in the data set) for that part, up to a certain limit.; and
At regular intervals, Supplier designates certain parts as SPs, based on past experience and intuition. That designation helps inform business decisions.
While the two criteria above constitute Supplier’s working definition of an SP, the company suspects that more detailed and specific rules involving other dimensions may also affect customer perception of SPs, like season and geographic location, and customer segment. The firm also suspects that SPs may vary from one customer to another.
